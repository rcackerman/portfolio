description_more: California’s redesigned child welfare case management system needed to be easy to use and collect accurate data. As a design team with a strong policy background and understanding of the user interface-data interaction, we focused on <strong>how to make a new system that made children safer by being a source of information to caseworkers, rather than just another system they needed to work around</strong>.

### Overview
For years the State of California had needed to replace their existing child welfare case management system, named CWS/CMS. It had been built in the early ‘90s and by the late aughts had reached the limits of its capacity. Finally, in 2015, the state had the money to replace the system, but knew that this time, they would need to build a system that actually met the needs of their frontline users. To do this, they ditched the traditional, waterfall RFP route in favor of an Agile process with modular contracting. Unlike the traditional model, California's newly-created Child Welfare Digital Services (CWDS) had state employees - mainly former social workers - working side-by-side with developers and designers from their contractors, in order to ensure that the system would work for end users.

Case Commons was brought in to build the first user-facing module, Intake. As the point of entry into the system (both real world and within the app), Intake frames the state's interaction with a family, often in stressful, hectic settings. We knew that the module needed to be a source of information for caseworkers, rather than just another system they needed to work around. As a design team with a strong policy background and understanding of the user interface-data interaction, we also wanted the user interface to mitigate potential biases and collect meaningful information for future policy research.

### Research
Our team was partnered with 6 counties across California and were given free reign to do any user experience research we deemed necessary. Our team wanted to understand the circumstances under which intake workers operated across the state, so we knew that on-the-ground observation would be necessary. Drawing on my policy and research background, I determined a few different strata over which we should observe. First, to see the variety of contexts social workers were operating within, we shadowed social workers doing rural and urban visits, both during the workday and after-hours, and working in multiple languages. Second, to see how social worker-specific differences impacted use, we shadowed social workers across a range of seniority, race, and gender. In total, I performed ride-alongs with social workers and conducted unstructured interviews in four California counties with about 20 caseworkers.

### Results

Incorporating the findings of my field research and those of my team, I created a detailed user journey map. That journey map was instrumental in developing our scope of work, which our state partners had been struggling to articulate. Originally, the RFP had assumed that each module could be separated out cleanly; the plan was to replace each module one at a time. The journey map showed that (unsurprisingly), the workflow was a bit more complex than anticipated. Showing these linkages allowed our state partners and vendors working on other modules to be more intentional about building interfaces.

After creating a detailed journey map, we created a more abstract journey map to collect feedback from social workers in follow-up county visits and to prioritize features in each development sprint.

Having a journey map also allowed us to layer on policy goals. Coming from an organization with a mission to improve child welfare practice through technology, our team evangelized the connection, without much traction. After meeting with senior policy leadership at CWDS to develop policy goals, I used the journey map as a tangible way to demonstrate how connected policy and user experience was - a much more impactful way of showing stakeholders than simply asking them to believe us.
