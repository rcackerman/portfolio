### Overview
California’s redesigned child welfare case management system needed to be easy to use and collect accurate data. As a design team with a strong policy background and understanding of the user interface-data interaction, we focused on how to make a new system that  made children safer by being a source of information to caseworkers, rather than just another system they needed to work around. 

### Research
I performed ride-alongs with social workers, conducted unstructured interviews, and did rapid prototyping in four California counties with about 20 caseworkers. As a team, we developed main research goals for each county, determined by product management questions and the development team’s location along the project roadmap. Because the research involved asking potentially sensitive questions, I worked with the state’s legal team to create a confidentiality statement for participants.

### Results
My field research culminated in a detailed user journey map that guided product development.

I also coached our state partners in creating a light-weight theory of change model for desired child welfare goals, to prioritize product development.
