### Overview
The City and County of San Francisco Human Services Agency (HSA) wanted help addressing churn – lapsed coverage because of missing paperwork – in their CalFresh client population. 

### Research
Our four-person team performed almost two months of in-depth qualitative research, including unstructured interviews to understand the goals and needs of CalFresh clients and eligibility staff, as well as workshops with eligibility staff to help design more client-friendly services.

I also worked with HSA leadership to figure out a way for me to apply for and enroll in CalFresh, in order to understand exactly what HSA clients were experiencing. Over the course of the year, I dropped out of the program in different ways to see how HSA communicated with clients. (You can see most of the letters [here](http://lippytak.github.io/calfresh/)!) 

### Findings
HSA's initial assumption was that almost all churn happened because clients were not filling out paperwork on time. Our team was able to validate that assumption, but also found a sizable subpopulation of cases where clients turned in their paperwork but it was never processed. These clients had no way of knowing that their paperwork had been lost, unless they were willing - and able - to call HSA repeatedly.

### Promptly
Informed by our initial research findings, our goals for Promptly were two-fold: 

* alert clients who had forgotten to turn in paperwork, and
* alert clients who had turned in paperwork that there was a problem.

In consultation with clients, staff, and non-profit advocates, we determined that a text message alert system would reduce burden on clients while not requiring an already stretched-thin HSA workforce to take on a lot of new work. Promptly, our text messaging service, was rolled out to San Francisco’s CalFresh clients in 2013.

I served as the main point person on the team for implementation planning, working with county legal staff to draft consent forms and training eligibility staff. I also worked on front-end development for the administrative interface and helped develop the initial UI.
