### Overview
The City and County of San Francisco Human Services Agency (HSA) wanted help addressing churn – lapsed coverage because of missing paperwork – in their CalFresh client population. 

### Research
To better empathize with CalFresh (SNAP) recipients, I worked with HSA leadership to apply for and enroll in CalFresh, dropping out of the program in different ways to see how HSA communicated with clients. (You can see most of the letters here!) Our team also performed almost two months of in-depth qualitative research, including unstructured interviews to understand the goals and needs of CalFresh clients and eligibility staff, as well as workshops with eligibility staff to help design more client-friendly services. 

### Findings
Our team found that much of the problem was due to paperwork getting lost in the CalFresh office, with no way for clients to know that they were about to lose benefits. In consultation with clients, staff, and non-profit advocates, we determined that a text message alert to clients would be a straightforward way of reducing churn.

Promptly, our text messaging service, was rolled out to San Francisco’s CalFresh clients in 2013, and was found to reduce churn. I served as the main point person on the team for implementation planning: working with county legal staff to draft consent forms and training eligibility staff.
