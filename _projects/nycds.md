description_more: New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) is one of three public defenders in Manhattan. To give the best advocacy possible, NYCDS attorneys work closely with social workers, investigators, immigration specialists, and others. However, NYCDS’ tech infrastructure was making collaboration cumbersome and prone to error.

### Overview
New York County Defender Services is one of 3 indigent criminal defense agencies in Manhattan (technically, New York County). In 2017, they were 20 years old, but had not changed their practices much since they started. In the meantime, the computer revolution - not to mention data revolution - had largely passed them by. 

The new executive director, encouraged by his funders, brought me in. Although my title was technically data scientist, my job description was more broad: to build a research portfolio, help executive staff understand how to use data and social science research, and do change management among staff who were wary of their work being monitored. As the executive director said when describing the role, I was being brought in to “define success before our funders do it for us.”

### Theory of Change
Since I wasn’t a defense attorney or a criminal justice expert, I knew I needed to get situated before embarking on any major success definition. I also knew that any attempt to create metrics of success would be looked at with skepticism by line staff, who were rightly worried about their work being judged without context. In order to familiarize staff with my work and give them a sense of agency in creating any definition of success, I decided to build a collaborative theory of change with all staff. In a series of workshops, I asked groups of staff to answer two questions: “What does the world look like when we’ve succeeded beyond our wildest dreams?” and “What short & long term initiatives will get us there?”

While I initially intended for the theory of change to inform metrics of organizational success, it really showed major blockers to success for staff. Fixing those issues became my north star for my own success at the organization.

### Findings & Solutions
The two biggest findings from the theory of change workshops were that
The inability to work outside of the office was a major impediment to quality representation.
Many wanted the ability to share and collaborate on documents.

We needed a way to get people access to their files and the files of other staff in a safe way. Cloud storage and online document editing, such as Microsoft Office365 or Google Suite, seemed like obvious solutions.

### Implementation

Unfortunately, there were some obstacles to cloud adoption that needed to be resolved before we could move people over. First, the person in charge of IT for the organization believed strongly in running her own servers. Second, executive staff were not convinced that we needed to change our current practices.

I addressed this by waging a 3-front campaign: making IT part of the solution, outlining benefits and costs of the status quo to executive staff, and finding champions among line staff. Perhaps most importantly, I figured out how to get cloud access for free - which was cheaper than the organization’s existing license for Microsoft Office.

#### Pilot phase
We tested both Office365 and Google Drive with staff in each functional unit. We created accounts for each user and gave them a few weeks to experiment with the software. Then I performed contextual interviews to determine strengths and weaknesses of each solution. Along with the Director of Administration, the head of IT, and Operations Director, I triangulated the findings of the contextual interviews with broader organizational requirements. We settled on Office365.

### Rollout
After seeing the range of comfort with cloud solutions, we decided to give staff access to Office365, but not mandate its use. Staff members who were more comfortable with their existing setup could continue to use the centralized file server. Because our senior management were among those not particularly comfortable with the cloud, I worked closely with the communication plan and provided technical support to anyone interested.
