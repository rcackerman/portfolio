title: Casebook
description_less: Promoting best practices in child welfare through human-centered software.
description_more: Case Commons wanted to make sure the Casebook, their commercial off-the-shelf case management system, was promoting best practices in child welfare, such as frequent safety visits to foster homes and collaborative case planning, as well as providing a system where caseworkers could do their work effectively and efficiently. On the Data Science & Policy team, I worked collaboratively with product teams to inform design and infrastructure decisions.
