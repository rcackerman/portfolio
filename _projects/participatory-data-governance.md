### Overview
Data governance is an issue of increasing importance in human services, but how to do it effectively is surprisingly under-studied. Through my work at the Division of Data and Improvement (DDI), within the Administration for Children and Families, I identified participatory data governance as a new area of interest for the unit.

### Methods
* Academic literature review
* Environment scan of grants, press releases, MOUs, and other data sharing artifacts

### Findings
In order to provide DDI staff with actionable information on participatory data governance and how to evaluate it, I wrote a 40-page report that reviews recent experiments with data governance in the fields of health policy and emerging technology, as well as proposing potential implementation strategies in human services.

The report is being used by DDI staff to inform their current contract work on data governance, and I am expanding the report to include a review of evaluation research on participatory governance.
