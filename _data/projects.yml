    <p>Making a new case management system that works with social workers, instead of against them.</p>

    <p> California’s redesigned child welfare case management system needed to be easy to use and collect accurate data. As a design team with a strong policy background and understanding of the user interface-data interaction, we focused on <strong>how to make a new system that made children safer by being a source of information to caseworkers, rather than just another system they needed to work around</strong>.</p>

    <p>Promoting best practices in child welfare through human-centered software.</p>

    <p>Case Commons wanted to make sure the Casebook, their commercial off-the-shelf case management system, was promoting best practices in child welfare, such as frequent safety visits to foster homes and collaborative case planning, as well as providing a system where caseworkers could do their work effectively and efficiently. On the Data Science & Policy team, I worked collaboratively with product teams to inform design and infrastructure decisions.</p>

  description_more: >
    <p>New York County Defender Services (NYCDS) is one of three public defenders in Manhattan. To give the best advocacy possible, NYCDS attorneys work closely with social workers, investigators, immigration specialists, and others. However, NYCDS’ tech infrastructure was making collaboration cumbersome and prone to error.</p>

    <p>Synthesizing research on how to make data governance more democratic.</p>
  description_more: >
    <p>Data governance is an issue of increasing importance in human services, but how to do it effectively is surprisingly under-studied. Through my work at the Division of Data and Improvement (DDI), within the Administration for Children and Families, I identified participatory data governance as a new area of interest for the unit.</p>
